			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>I am a recent graduate of <font color=teal>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</font> with a B.S degree in <font color=teal>Interdisciplinary Science</font>. My coursework included classes primarily in <font color=teal>Computer Science</font>, Physics and Mathematics, which has improved my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I am a flexible individual with the ability to hit the ground running in any environment. My involvement in youth development and education has given me insight into better ways to teach and learn. 
			</p>
			<p>I like doing a <b>lot</b> of things, and this is one of them! I'm not the kind of person who could be satisfied with just doing one thing, so I make an effort to round myself off with numerous projects. I pick things up very quickly, so don't be surprised if this page changes if you refresh :P

		<div class="container" id="personal_about">
			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p> I love a lot of things, from sports to video games to animals to people to buildings! Everything is interesting in some way, and somethings are interesting at different times! It's wild living in a time where we have access to any and everything, and it'll be an interesting journey to see where we as a whole end up. Honestly, it's hard to find something that I can't find an interest in</p>
			<p>Seriously, I love video games. You can probably find who I am in most games pretty easily and I'll try to keep an updated list here for you!</p>

				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h5>Bachelor - Interdisciplinary Science (Specialization: Computer Science)</h5>
					<h6>I studied as an engineer for three years before taking a very basic programming class and changing tracks completely. After that it was two years of back to back to back programming and general computer science cramming until graduation. Now I still share the same interest that brought me to the industry to begin with, and I feel now just as I did then. There is nothing in this field that I cannot do.</h6>

					<h6>I graduated highschool with math and physics being my favorite subjects, but far the most enjoyable aspect of attending Riordan was being involved with the Marching and Concert band. I had already had experience with playing music, but Scott Souza took that too a whole nother level.
